# OpenWanderer server apps

Within this repository are three example apps making use of both the client `jsapi` and the server. Note that there are, or will be, examples for both the PHP server and the new Node.js server.

- `hello-world` : a Hello World OpenWanderer server app. Contains the absolute basic server and JavaScript code to view panoramas by ID and navigate along sequences.

- `basic` : a very basic usable app. Allows you to upload sequences of panoramas, as well as search for a panorama by ID or latitude/longitude and navigate along a pano sequence. 

- `full` : the full example OpenWanderer application; essentially a cut-down version of [OpenTrailView](https://www.opentrailview.org). Allows you to upload sequences and navigate along them, if you are logged in (a signup facility is available). Also shows pano locations on a map and allows you to adjust the pan, tilt and roll of panoramas. On the map interface, you may navigate to a pano by clicking on its icon, as well as rotate, move and delete individual panoramas.

- `otv-openwanderer` : an implementation of [OpenTrailView](https://www.opentrailview.org) using OpenWanderer. node.js version only.
